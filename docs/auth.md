# Authorization

Before you can use the API you must be authorised.  Sark65 API uses Laravel Sanctum, which is token based, a little like Github personal-access-tokens.   Before you can use the API you must have a Bearer Token. You may obtain a token in one of two ways:-

* an administrator may issue you with a traditional UID/PWD.  When you authorize yourself (i.e. login) with the correct credentials then you will be returned a "Bearer Token" which you must supply in the Auth Header for all subsequent calls to the API. 

* an administrator may issue you directly with a Bearer Token.  In these cases there is no requirement to login.   Instead you simply use the Bearer Token when you issue a request to the API.

As an <i>unauthorised</i> user, the ONLY API endpoint you can access is <i>login</i>.   Unless, or until, you succesfully authorize yourself then you will have no other access.  It therefore follows that ALL other requests must be accompanied by a Bearer Token in the Auth Header.

##Examples
####Example:1 Login
![Login](assets/images/ExampleLogin.png)
After login you must save the <i>"accessToken"</i> for subsequent use.
####Example 2: GET
In this example we will retrieve details for SIP Extension 1000.<br/>

First we must set the query with the accessToken we received from the login (or from an Administrator). We are using Postman for these examples so it's easy enough to set the bearer in Postman's "Authorization" tab.  Then we can run the query to retrieve details for an Extension (in this case Ext1000).
